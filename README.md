I was able to complete all tasks to the best of my ability 
I found the recyclerview fragments and intent portions easy to implement 
Implementing an Asynctask was difficult for me because I still feel uncomfortable with that material and i found navigating 
from a recyclerview item to a fragment to be difficult as well I spent a good chunk of time on stackoverflow finding
why getSupportFragmentManager wasnt callable in recyclerviewholder
